# CLAMSwrangler
To simplify and expedite the processing of the raw data generated by the [Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring
System (CLAMS)](https://www.colinst.com/products/clams-comprehensive-lab-animal-monitoring-system) we developed CLAMSwrangler.

This program handles the cleaning, trimming, and binning of data generated by CLAMS.
